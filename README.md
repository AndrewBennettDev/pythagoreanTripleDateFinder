# Pythagorean Triples Date Finder

### Why?
This is a simple app to find the dates from the year 1900 to 3000 where the dates are a Pythagorean triple. This simple means that the day squared plus the month squared is
equal to the last two digits of the year squared. 

Example: July 24, 2025 => 7^2 + 24^2 = 25^2

### Acknowledgements
Thank you to Jake for sharing this idea with me (along with a thousand other great maths things), and to Alan for asking "Why is there a 1 in the middle of each function call?" Because I'm a ding dong, Alan, because I'm a ding dong.
